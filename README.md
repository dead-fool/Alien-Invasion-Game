## Alien-Invasion-Game

#ðŸ‘½ Alien Invasion
Alien invasion is a clone of popular arcade game with same name. I created this game by following the "Python Crash Course" book. The reason was to improve my python skills. I have utilized pygame and its different features to implement the game. The game as guided by the book had a play button on start and
the game would give you the same button again when it was over. The game could store the highscore during the current session and would not
store it permanently. 
Every other little details and features besides that have been my addition to the game.

#ðŸš€ Introduction 
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
