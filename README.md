# Alien-Invasion-Game

This is my iteration of the classic Alien Invasion game which is modelled based on the project of Crash course on Python book.

I have utilized pygame and its different features to implement the game. The game as guided by the book had a play button on start and
the game would give you the same button again when it was over. The game could store the highscore during the current session and would not
store it permanently.

Every other little feature has been my addition to the game. It was fun to do.
